                <p>Adam Goodson--These are four of my favorite places to go for a walk in Gainesville. Univeristy of Florida students and Gainesville residents may tire from the indoors and want to go for a walk. Paines Prarie located right outside of Gainesville is one of the best places to do so. If you do not want to venture to far Sweetwater Wetlands Park is an excelent place to go for a walk or a run with florida scenery. Depot Park is a nice option for people who do not wish to be so close to nature but instead just enjoy a walk in the park. For UF students who do not want to venture off campus Lake Alice offers a nice walk especially during the sunset.</p>
